  <dt>In the experiments folder, there are:</dt>
  <dd>bottomup_data.csv: Experiment on time complexity of bottom-up approach.</dd>
  <dd>topdown_data.csv: Experiment on time complexity of top-down approach.</dd>
  <dd>bruteforce.csv: Experiment on time complexity of bruteforce approach.</dd>
  <dd>btm_optimized_memory_compare.csv: Experiment on memory complexity of bottom-up approach with optimization. 
    On the left side, measuring memory allocated with n and W variables both changed. 
    On the right side, measuring memory allocated with n changed and W unchaged.</dd>

**Input folder** contains inputs for test cases.</br>
**Output folder** contains outputs of according inputs given in **input folder**.</br>

**cs112.ipynb**: file is used to predict runtime of each approach in different time complexity functions, using linear regression.
